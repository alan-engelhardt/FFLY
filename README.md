Mobile-First-RWD
================

[This demo](http://bradfrostweb.com/demo/mobile-first/) is an example of a mobile-first responsive web design. This is a companion demo to the [tutorial I wrote on HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/) and subsequent [anatomy of its components](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/anatomy-of-a-mobile-first-responsive-web-design/).
